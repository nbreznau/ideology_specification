#### Abstract

When studying policy-relevant topics, researchers’ policy preferences may shape the design, execution, analysis, and interpretation of results. Detection of such bias is challenging because the research process itself is not normally part of a controlled experimental setting. Our analysis exploits a rare opportunity where 158 researchers working independently in 71 research teams participated in an experiment. They used the same data to answer the same well-defined empirical question: Does immigration reduce public support for social welfare policies? The researchers were surveyed about their position on immigration policy prior to conducting the research. Using those survey responses and the outcomes of their empirical analysis, we measure the impact of ideological priors on the estimates they produced. We find that research teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration research teams reported more negative estimates. Moreover, the methods used by teams with strong pro- or anti-immigration priors received lower “referee scores” from their peers in the experiment. These lower-rated models, however, produced the different effects estimated by the teams at the tails of the immigration sentiment distribution. Our results make a case for viewing political ideology as an important factor in the debate over making science more reliable and reproducible.
